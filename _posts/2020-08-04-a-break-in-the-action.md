It's been a little while since my last post on the microservices series - apologies!  Unfortunately I managed to fall off my bike and break my arm, which has made typing...well, difficult, to say the least :)  I've got what's called a [Galeazzi Fracture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galeazzi_fracture), which required surgery to repair (and leaves me with some cool plates and screws).

Enjoy your summer, and be safer on your bike than I was!  I'll be back in the fall - for right now I'm focused on resting my arm and letting it heal.
